# /hody-workflow:start-feature

Start a spec-driven, multi-phase feature development workflow.

## User Instructions

$ARGUMENTS

If the section above contains text, first parse the **execution mode**, then treat the remainder as the feature description:

### Execution Mode

Parse the arguments for mode flags (case-insensitive):
- `--auto` or starts with `auto:` → set execution mode to **auto**
- `--manual` or starts with `manual:` → set execution mode to **manual**
- Neither → default to **guided**

Strip the mode flag from the remaining text before treating it as the feature description.

| Mode | Discovery | Spec | Agent Execution |
|------|-----------|------|-----------------|
| **auto** | Skip — auto-generate spec from description + KB | Auto-confirm (no user input) | Run all agents without stopping |
| **guided** (default) | Interactive — ask user questions | User confirms | Run all agents without stopping |
| **manual** | Interactive — ask user questions | User confirms | Pause between each agent for review |

### Feature Description

Use the remaining text (after stripping mode flag) to:
- Pre-fill step 2 (feature description) so you can skip asking if the description is clear enough
- Apply focus areas (e.g. "focus on security" → emphasize code-reviewer + spec-verifier)
- Narrow scope (e.g. "only backend" → skip frontend agent in BUILD)
- Override the default agent sequence if the user explicitly requests it

If empty and mode is `auto`, inform the user that `--auto` requires a feature description and fall back to `guided` mode.
If empty and mode is `guided` or `manual`, ask the user for the feature description normally.

## Workflow Overview

This command follows a **spec-driven development** approach:

```
DISCOVERY → SPEC CONFIRMATION → AUTO-EXECUTION
     ↑              │
     └──────────────┘  (iterate until user confirms)
```

1. **Discovery**: Ask all clarifying questions upfront, discuss trade-offs with user (**skipped in `auto` mode**)
2. **Spec Confirmation**: Summarize everything into a clear spec, user confirms (**auto-confirmed in `auto` mode**)
3. **Execution**: Run all agents in sequence (**pauses between agents in `manual` mode**)

## Steps

### Phase A: Discovery

1. **Check initialization**: Verify `.hody/profile.yaml` exists. If not, run `/hody-workflow:init` first.

2. **Read project context**: Read `.hody/profile.yaml` and all `.hody/knowledge/` files to understand the current project state.

3. **Gather feature description**: If not provided in arguments, ask the user to describe the feature. (In `auto` mode, a description MUST be provided in arguments.)

4. **Classify feature type**: Based on the description, classify into one of these types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `new-feature` | Entirely new functionality |
| `bug-fix` | Fix a reported bug |
| `refactor` | Restructure existing code without changing behavior |
| `api-endpoint` | New or modified API endpoint |
| `ui-change` | Frontend-only change |
| `tech-spike` | Research and prototyping |
| `deployment` | Infrastructure or deployment change |
| `hotfix` | Urgent production fix |

5. **Generate discovery questions**: Based on the feature type, tech stack (from profile.yaml), and existing knowledge base, compile a **single batch** of all questions that need clarification. Group them by category:

**For `new-feature` / `api-endpoint`:**
- **Architecture**: Where does this fit in the current system? New service or extend existing?
- **API Design**: What endpoints are needed? Request/response shapes? Auth requirements?
- **Data Model**: New tables/collections? Schema changes? Migrations needed?
- **Business Logic**: What are the core rules? Edge cases? Error scenarios?
- **Frontend** (if applicable): What UI components? User flow? State management approach?
- **Testing**: Coverage requirements? Integration test scenarios? E2E needed?
- **Deployment**: Feature flags? Rollback plan? Environment-specific config?

**For `bug-fix` / `hotfix`:**
- **Reproduction**: Steps to reproduce? Which environments?
- **Root Cause**: Known cause or needs investigation? Related recent changes?
- **Scope**: Which components are affected? Is it isolated or systemic?
- **Testing**: How to verify the fix? Regression tests needed?

**For `refactor`:**
- **Scope**: Which modules/files? What patterns to introduce/remove?
- **Behavior**: Must behavior stay identical? Any acceptable changes?
- **Testing**: Existing test coverage? Additional tests needed?
- **Migration**: Breaking API changes? Backward compatibility needed?

**For `tech-spike`:**
- **Goal**: What question are we trying to answer?
- **Constraints**: Time box? Must integrate with existing stack?
- **Output**: Prototype? Comparison doc? ADR?

Present ALL questions at once. Let the user answer in any order, partially, or all at once.

6. **Iterate until clear**: If answers are vague or raise new questions, ask follow-ups. But always batch questions — never ask one at a time. Continue until you have enough information to write a spec.

**If mode is `auto`**: Skip steps 5-6 entirely. Instead, use the feature description from arguments combined with existing knowledge base context (architecture.md, api-contracts.md, decisions.md) to generate the spec directly. Make reasonable assumptions based on the codebase. Do NOT ask any questions — proceed straight to Phase B.

### Phase B: Spec Confirmation

7. **Write the spec**: Synthesize all discovery answers into a structured spec document. Present it to the user:

```
Feature Spec: [title]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Type: [classified type]
Priority: [high/medium/low]

## Summary
[1-2 sentence description of what will be built]

## Requirements
- [Req 1]
- [Req 2]
- ...

## Technical Design
- Architecture: [approach]
- API Endpoints: [list with methods, paths, request/response]
- Data Model: [schema changes]
- Key Decisions: [trade-offs made during discovery]

## Out of Scope
- [What we explicitly won't do in this feature]

## Agent Workflow
  THINK:  [agents]
  BUILD:  [agents]
  VERIFY: [agents]
  SHIP:   [agents] (optional)

Estimated agents: [N] agents across [M] phases
```

8. **Get user confirmation**:

**If mode is `auto`**: Auto-confirm the spec. Show a brief 3-5 line summary of the spec so the user can see what was generated, but do NOT wait for input. Immediately proceed to execution.

**If mode is `guided` or `manual`**: Ask the user to confirm or request changes. The user may:
- Approve as-is → proceed to execution
- Request changes → update spec and re-present
- Add/remove agents → adjust the workflow
- Change scope → update requirements

Do NOT proceed to execution until the user explicitly confirms.

### Phase C: Execution

9. **Save spec to knowledge base**: Write the confirmed spec to `.hody/knowledge/spec-<slugified-feature>.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
tags: [spec, <feature-type>, <relevant-tags>]
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
author-agent: start-feature
status: confirmed
---

# Spec: [feature title]

[Full spec content from step 7]
```

10. **Create workflow state and feature log**: Create `.hody/state.json`:

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "feat-<slugified-description>-<YYYYMMDD>",
  "feature": "<user's feature description>",
  "type": "<classified type>",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "execution_mode": "<auto|guided|manual>",
  "spec_confirmed": true,
  "spec_file": "spec-<slugified-feature>.md",
  "log_file": "log-<slugified-feature>.md",
  "created_at": "<ISO 8601 UTC>",
  "updated_at": "<ISO 8601 UTC>",
  "phases": {
    "<PHASE>": {
      "agents": ["<agent1>", "<agent2>"],
      "completed": [],
      "active": null,
      "skipped": []
    }
  },
  "phase_order": ["THINK", "BUILD", "VERIFY", "SHIP"],
  "agent_log": []
}
```

Create the **feature log** file at `.hody/knowledge/log-<slugified-feature>.md`:

```markdown
---
tags: [log, <feature-type>]
date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
author-agent: start-feature
status: in_progress
---

# Feature Log: <feature title>

Type: <feature-type>
Started: <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Spec
-> spec-<slugified-feature>.md

## Agent Work
```

This log file is where each agent will append its detailed work record. It tracks:
- What each agent did (summary)
- Files created and modified in the codebase
- KB files updated
- Key decisions made

Also create a tracker item:

```bash
python3 ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/project-profile/scripts/tracker.py create \
  --type task \
  --title "<feature description>" \
  --tags "<relevant tags>" \
  --priority medium \
  --cwd .
```

11. **Run agents based on execution mode**: For each agent in sequence:
   - Set it as `active` in state.json, add `agent_log` entry
   - Activate the agent (it reads profile.yaml + KB + spec file + log file)
   - When agent completes:
     - Update state.json (completed, output_summary, kb_files_modified)
     - Agent appends its work record to the log file (files created/modified, KB updated, decisions)
   - Show a one-line status update:
     ```
     ✅ researcher completed — "Researched OAuth2 providers" → Starting architect...
     ```

   **Mode-specific behavior after each agent:**

   - **`auto` or `guided`**: **Immediately** proceed to the next agent — do NOT pause to ask the user.
   - **`manual`**: Pause and show a review prompt:
     ```
     ✅ researcher completed — "Researched OAuth2 providers"

     Next: architect (THINK phase)
     → continue | skip | abort
     ```
     Wait for the user to respond before proceeding.

   **Parallel agents**: During BUILD phase, if both `frontend` and `backend` are present, run them in parallel (all modes).

12. **Complete workflow**: After all agents finish:
   - Finalize the feature log (append Summary section, update status to `completed`)
   - Set workflow status to `completed`
   - Show a final summary of all agent outputs
   - Update spec file status to `implemented`

## Agent Sequence by Feature Type

| Type | Agent Sequence |
|------|---------------|
| `new-feature` | researcher → architect → frontend + backend → unit-tester → integration-tester → code-reviewer → spec-verifier |
| `bug-fix` | architect → frontend or backend → unit-tester → code-reviewer |
| `refactor` | code-reviewer (assess) → frontend or backend → unit-tester → code-reviewer (verify) |
| `api-endpoint` | architect → backend → integration-tester → code-reviewer |
| `ui-change` | frontend → unit-tester → code-reviewer |
| `tech-spike` | researcher → architect |
| `deployment` | devops |
| `hotfix` | frontend or backend → unit-tester → devops |

## Output

### During Discovery
- Present all questions grouped by category
- Show the iterative spec as it develops

### During Execution
- One-line per agent completion
- Final summary with all outputs

## Notes

- **Three execution modes**: `auto` (no interaction), `guided` (interactive discovery, auto execution), `manual` (interactive discovery, pause between agents)
- **`auto` mode** skips discovery and spec confirmation — best for well-described features or simple tasks
- **`guided` mode** (default) iterates with the user until spec is clear, then runs agents without interruption
- **`manual` mode** gives full control — user reviews each agent's output before proceeding
- Frontend and backend agents can run in parallel during BUILD phase (all modes)
- SHIP phase (devops) is included only for deployment/hotfix types
- Each agent reads the spec file + KB, so context flows naturally between agents
- If interrupted, use `/hody-workflow:resume` — it respects the persisted execution mode
- Workflow state (including `execution_mode`) is persisted in `.hody/state.json`
- The feature log provides a complete audit trail of all work done — review it after workflow completes
