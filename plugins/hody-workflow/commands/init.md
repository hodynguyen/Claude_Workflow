# /hody:init

Initialize Hody Workflow for the current project.

## Steps

1. **Detect tech stack**: Run the project-profile skill to scan the project and generate `.hody/profile.yaml`

```bash
python3 ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/project-profile/scripts/detect_stack.py --cwd .
```

2. **Create knowledge base**: Copy template files to `.hody/knowledge/` if they don't already exist

Copy each template from `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/knowledge-base/templates/` to `.hody/knowledge/`:
- `architecture.md`
- `decisions.md`
- `api-contracts.md`
- `business-rules.md`
- `tech-debt.md`
- `runbook.md`

Only copy files that don't already exist — never overwrite existing knowledge.

3. **Show summary**: Display the detected stack and created files

## Output

After running, show the user:
- Detected project type (fullstack, frontend, backend, etc.)
- Detected frameworks and languages
- List of knowledge base files created
- Suggest next steps: "You can now use agents like architect, code-reviewer, or unit-tester"

## Notes

- This command only needs to run once per project
- `.hody/profile.yaml` can be re-generated by running this command again
- Knowledge base files are never overwritten — only missing files are created
- Recommend committing `.hody/` to git for team sharing
